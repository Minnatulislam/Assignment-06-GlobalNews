                <p><strong class="fs-3">Var :</strong>
                    Before the advent of ES6, var declarations ruled. There are issues associated with variables
                    declared with var,
                    though. That is why it was necessary for new ways to declare variables to emerge. First, let's get
                    to understand
                    var more before we discuss those issues.
                </p>
                <p><strong class="fs-3">Let :</strong>
                     The let keyword was introduced in ES6 (2015).
                    Variables defined with let cannot be Redeclared.
                    Variables defined with let must be Declared before use.
                     Variables defined with let have Block Scope.</p>
                
                <p><strong class="fs-3">Const :</strong>
                The const keyword was introduced in ES6 (2015).

                Variables defined with const cannot be Redeclared.

                Variables defined with const cannot be Reassigned.

                Variables defined with const have Block Scope.

                <h3 class="fs-bold"> 3. Difference between Map, Foreach, Filter ?</h3>
                <p>
                <h3>Foreach:</h3>forEach(), is used to execute the same code on every element in an array but does not
                change
                the array and it returns undefined.</p>
                <p>
                <h3>Map:</h3>
                map() executes the same code on every element in an array and returns a new array with the updated
                elements.</p>
                <p>
                <h3>Filter:</h3>.filter() checks every element in an array to see if it meets a certain criteria and
                returns a
                new array with the elements that return truthy for the criteria.</p>
                <h3 class="fs-bold">4. Why we use Temple string in JS?</h3>
                <p>Template literals provide an easy way to interpolate variables and expressions into strings.

                    The method is called string interpolation.</p>
